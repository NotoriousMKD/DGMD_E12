    <h2> Bauhas Landscape by Meredith Davies </h2>
      <p>
        I looked at bunches of the Bauhaus paintings, objects, and textiles, but I kept returning to this simple oil painting by Sewell Sillman called Abstraction. I like the way the artist has taken bits out of the larger shapes and moved them to other places on the page. I love the color scheme. I find the image whimsical but also challenging.

        The painting is pretty simple, so I tried to reimagine it as a landscape that stayed close to the original color palette. I wanted to use all of the same types of form that Sillman used. I started with the mountain shape. When considering how to incorporate the arc/elliptical shape, I decided it would make sense to use it as a sun. Putting it in the upper right felt too predictable, so I decided to place it along the bottom of the page with the bottom of the mountains. Many of my choices were a combination of trying to maintain a minimal design while meeting the requirements of the assignment. I tried to make the rays of the sun be created using a loop, but ultimately I failed at that.

        This was such a fun project to work on and helped me get the hang of a lot of the concepts we’ve been studying. I had to scrap several ideas because I thought I understood how to implement them but didn’t quite get there...but I the learning is happening in the struggle!
